# ====  Game design document  ====
This is my format of writing a game design document . 
Other documents like character design docs can be included within the project documentation . 


gameDoc.odt should be opened with libreoffice writer if editing is necessary. 
gameDoc.pdf can be simply opened in the browser or pdf reader software. 

feel free to outline areas i have missed and ask for a pull request maybe . Game design docs should not be boring and should be simple for everyone to understand .
